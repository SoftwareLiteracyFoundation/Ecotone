## Ecotone Dynamics Agent Based Models 
Three [NetLogo](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/) Ecotone Dynamics Models.

These models characterize observed and future freshwater coastal marsh to saltwater mangrove estuary ecotone dynamics in response to rising sea levels.  [It is suggested](doc/Ecological_Modelling_Submission.pdf) that quantifying landscape vegetation changes from fresh to salt tolerant species informs the underlying fresh to saltwater transformation in the surficial aquifer.
